- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hadesblade1
- 👀 I’m interested in electric vehicles, space, technology and maths in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program and build a solid skillset to work in one of the fields above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help teach me newer things and grow my connections in the process.
